# Build → Test Checklist

Every feature build gets a row here with concrete test steps. A build isn't "done" until **Tested ✅**.
Claude adds new builds here as they're made; you check them off as you test.

**Legend:** ⬜ not done · ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⏳ waiting (external) · ❌ blocked/failed

> 📱 **Device build is current** — `npm run build && npx cap copy ios` run 2026-07-17, so items 1–3 are ready to test in the Simulator/device (set a Simulator location: Features → Location → Custom, e.g. New York 40.7128, -74.0060).

## Test steps

### 1 · Home-city timezone
- [ ] Settings → set a home **city** (e.g., Los Angeles) → reload → it persisted
- [ ] Home shows the correct **home timezone** (LA → Pacific, not Eastern)
- [ ] Here / Selected / Home clock rows only appear when their zones actually differ

### 2 · Engagement rows (Wave 1)
- [x] Endpoint returns rows via curl (verified: NYC → Times Square, Statue of Liberty)
- [ ] Rows render on **Home** (below Money Exchange) in a seeded city
- [ ] Swipe a row **sideways**; cards show photo + name + meta
- [ ] **"See all"** opens the correct finder page
- [ ] Two opens at different times of day show **different** row titles/order
- [ ] Outside a seeded city → **no empty rows** (falls back cleanly)

### 3 · Silent auto-follow location
- [ ] In GPS mode, move ~>10km to a new city → results/rows update to the new city
- [ ] On app **foreground** in a new city → it refreshes
- [ ] A **manually-picked** city (navigate mode) is **NOT** overridden
- [ ] Settings toggle "Update to my location as I travel" shows and turns it off

### 4 · Reverse-geocode cache
> ⚠️ 2026-07-17: first test FAILED — both calls returned `cached:false` (write was fire-and-forget, got cancelled). **Fixed** (worker line 4909 now `await`s the KV put). **Redeploy the worker, then re-run.**
- [ ] `wrangler deploy` the worker (picks up the await fix)
- [ ] `curl` the same coords twice → 2nd response includes `"cached": true`
- [ ] City name is correct for the coords

### 5 · AdMob production ads
- [x] Real (non-"Test mode") ad shows on the live App Store build

### 6 · app-ads.txt
- [x] `https://globeskimmers.io/app-ads.txt` returns the plain-text line, 200

---

### 7 · Demand + tap logging
Frontend-only (no worker deploy) — events flow via `trackEvent → logEvent → D1`. Reading/aggregating them (trending row, B2B dashboard) is a later build that needs a new allowlisted `ANALYTICS_QUERIES` entry.
- [ ] Load Home in a city → a `home_rows_view` event fires (city / country / intent / row_count)
- [ ] Tap a card → `home_row_card_tap` (place_id, name, category, city, country)
- [ ] Tap "See all" → `home_row_see_all` (row, action)
- [ ] Verify in D1: `wrangler d1 execute globeskimmers-events --remote --command "SELECT event_type, payload, ts FROM events WHERE event_type LIKE 'home_%' ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 10"` shows the rows
